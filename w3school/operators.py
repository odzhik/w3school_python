# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

# Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
# =	x = 5	x = 5	
x = 5
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
x += 5 
x = x +5
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
x - = 5
x = x + 5
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
x *= 5
x = x * 5
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
x /= 5
x = x / 5
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	

# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
x &= 3 
x = x & 3
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
x ^= 5 x = x ^ 5
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3

# Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# Operator	Name	Example	Try it
# ==	Equal	x == y	
x == y
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
x !=  y
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	

# Python Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

# Python Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

# Operator	Description	Example	Try it
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y
